# Employee-Roster

## Description
This project uses mySQL database to keep track of employee information. Using foreign keys relationships between each set of employee informatio can be easily referenced to pull in the correct information the user is looking for. This project uses the inquirer npm package so the database queries are handled within the users command line terminal.
